{"name":"Vocoder","tagline":"Program that imposes vocal effects on a waveform","body":"__Project status:__ still useful, but is no longer under development.  \r\n__Developed:__ 1996-2002\r\n\r\nThis program is a free software channel vocoder, which imposes vocal effects on a waveform. It can be used to make your voice sound \"robot-like\", to create a singing synthesizer, to disguise your voice, and many other fun things. This effect was made popular by artists such as Kraftwerk and Laurie Anderson, and Daft Punk (using other hardware/software).  This particular software works on pre-recorded files, rather than being a live effect.\r\n\r\n![Vocoder Screen Shot](http://s3.amazonaws.com/borsboom-assets/vocoder/screen_shot.gif)\r\n\r\nI originally created this software after doing a research paper about vocoders for a course I took in my first year of University.   At the time there were not many options for easy software vocoding, although since then many good ones, such as VST plugins, have become available.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nHere are some examples of the vocoder output and unput files in Microsoft WAVe format.\r\n\r\n* [example1.wav](http://s3.amazonaws.com/borsboom-downloads/vocoder/examples/example1.wav) - vocoded using periodic white noise as a carrier<\r\n* [example2.wav](http://s3.amazonaws.com/borsboom-downloads/vocoder/examples/example2.wav) - vocoded using white noise as a carrier\r\n* [example3.wav](http://s3.amazonaws.com/borsboom-downloads/vocoder/examples/example3.wav) - vocoded using synthesized strings as a carrier\r\n\r\nHere are the modulator and carrier files I used to create them:\r\n\r\n* [modulator22.wav](http://s3.amazonaws.com/borsboom-downloads/vocoder/examples/modulator22.wav) - my voice modulator\r\n* [carrier22.wav](http://s3.amazonaws.com/borsboom-downloads/vocoder/examples/carrier22.wav) - synthesized strings carrier\r\n* [white512.wav](http://s3.amazonaws.com/borsboom-downloads/vocoder/examples/white512.wav) - periodic white noise carrier\r\n* [white.wav](http://s3.amazonaws.com/borsboom-downloads/vocoder/examples/white.wav) - white noise carrier\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\nThe vocoder is available as C source code or as a compiled binary for certain\r\nplatforms. The source code should compile just about anywhere.\r\n\r\nDownload the latest version for your operating system/processor:\r\n\r\n* [InstallZeriusVocoder13.exe](http://s3.amazonaws.com/borsboom-downloads/vocoder/InstallZeriusVocoder13.exe) - Windows 95/98/NT/2000/XP/etc. with Graphical User Interface (v1.3)\r\n* [vocoder-1.2-x86-win32.zip](http://s3.amazonaws.com/borsboom-downloads/vocoder/vocoder-1.2-x86-win32.zip) - Windows 95/98/NT/2000/XP/etc. Command-Line (v1.2): Use this version if you are using one of the older front-ends, or want to use the vocoder in batch files.  Otherwise, use the above GUI version.\r\n* Source code is on [Github](https://github.com/borsboom/vocoder).\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n* [Manual](https://github.com/borsboom/vocoder/raw/master/README.txt)\r\n* [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/borsboom/vocoder/wiki/FAQ)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
